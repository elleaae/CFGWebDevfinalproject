            <h4 id="simple-list-item-1">Causes</h4>
            <p>The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) kicked off its <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/" target="_blank">2021 report</a> a with the following statement: “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.” 
                How are we so certain? It took a while, but climate modelling is now refined enough to predict how things would go without human influence, within a margin of error. What we are observing today, however, is beyond that margin of error, therefore proving that we have driven the change. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Since the beginning of the Industrial Age, we have invented and manufactured a lot of things that made us more comfortable. We’ve become technologically advanced. Airplanes, Cars, Ships and other vehicles, they can be found everywhere. A lot of factories sprung up to keep manufacturing the artificial things that we’ve come to rely on. All of this requires vast amounts of energy, and our main source of energy are fossil fuels, mainly coal.
                    Burning fossil fuels releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing an imbalance in the amount of greenhouse gases – resulting to the greenhouse effect. More heat is trapped in the planet and our temperature on the surface rises.</p>
            <h4 id="simple-list-item-2">Greenhouse Gases</h4>
            <p>The global climate is changing due to human influence, and not for the better. Plants are flowering sooner, glaciers are melting, and ice on rivers are breaking. This is happening because excessive greenhouse gas emissions result in an adverse greenhouse effect.
                Greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth's atmosphere. This keeps the planet comfortably warm at a global average of 15 degrees Celsius; we call this the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect keeps the earth habitable. However, greenhouse gas emissions have skyrocketed in recent times, and now, the world is becoming hotter.</p>
            <h4 id="simple-list-item-3">Ocean</h4>
            <p>A 2019 study found that oceans had sucked up 90% of the heat gained by the planet between 1971 and 2010. Another found that it absorbed 20 sextillion joules of heat in 2020 – equivalent to two Hiroshima bombs per second. The ocean has tremendous volume and heat-storage capacity, which is why some organisms are used to temperatures being quite stable. Of these, coral reefs are particularly sensitive to temperature levels, reason for which <strong>many</strong> are now dying off.  </p>
            <h4 id="simple-list-item-4">Ice</h4>
            <p>Since the mid-1990s, we’ve lost around 28 trillion tons of ice, with today’s melt rate standing at 1.2 trillion tons a year. To help you put that into perspective, the combined weight of all human-made things is 1.1 trillion tons. That’s about the same weight as all living things on earth. </p>
            <h4 id="simple-list-item-5">Climate Movement</h4>
            <p>Climate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change. They can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities. Prominent demonstrations include the School Strike for Climate. In this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. Mass civil disobedience actions by groups like Extinction Rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport. Litigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action from public institutions and companies. Activists also initiate lawsuits which target governments and demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws on climate change.Lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies generally seek compensation for loss and damage.</p>
